# :star: MyNotes
A simple and elegant note-taking app designed to help users quickly jot down notes and manage them efficiently. This project was developed as a training exercise to practice building a React Native app with glassmorphism effects and persistent storage using AsyncStorage. It is suitable for anyone looking to build similar applications or learn about these technologies.
